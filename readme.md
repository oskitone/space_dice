# Space Dice

Work in progress!

## 3D Models

3D-printed models are written in OpenSCAD.

### Dependencies

Assumes the `parts_cafe` repo is in a sibling directory and _up to date_ on the `main` branch. Here's how I've got it:

    \ oskitone
        \ space_dice
        \ parts_cafe

You'll also need to install the [Orbitron](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron) font.
